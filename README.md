# Proposal

Preon programming language is pure functional language that aims to support
all major platforms and operating systems - Android, iOS, Web but also Unix and Windows.

To achieve such wide support (without loosing speed, especially on mobile platforms)
language will be compiled to platforms' "native" languages. This means that compiling
to Java, Swift, JavaScript and C/C++ will be supported. Using platform's "native"
language as target of compilation will also make it easy and effective to wire native
code and fucntions with Preon pure functions - most likely with monads and some kind
of native function invocation.
